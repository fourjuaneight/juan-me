I'm Juan and I make websites for a living. I've worked for the better part of a decade in IT until I decided to make things instead of rebooting them. For the entirety of my development career, I’ve worked freelance. Due to my lack of relevant experience when starting, I was unable to get a job. So, I made one for myself. The majority of my time has been spent working through UpWork where clients from all over the globe hire me to redesign or build their sites and applications.

I make websites that I would go to. That means they’re fast, accessible, intuitive and responsive. Although there are plenty of tools to make this happen, I prefer using static-site generators. Hugo and Gatsby are my favorites. They’re fast and scalable. I write clean and light code, with other developers that’ll come after me in mind. I’ve done some work with Ruby on Rails redesigning web apps and creating new sites. I favor CSS for animations over JavaScript, semantic HTML, and readable code. And I can work with designers, developers, product managers, or consult on how a static-site can best suit your needs.

Other than that, there's not much else you need to know about me; I'm not all that interesting. I'm a voracious reader, like going to the movies, follow a ton of webcomics, and listen to a ton of podcasts. I delivered a baby once; that's interesting, right?

Anyhow, this site serves two purposes: a testing ground for new web technologies I'm learning and a place to share my coding journey. So ideally you'll see the quality of the site improve and the source code constantly evolve.

  <h3>Here's some of the recent work I've done.</h3>
  <li>
    <h4><a href="https://www.rustledjimmies.net" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rustled Jimmies</a></h4>
    {{< img src="jimmies.jpg" >}}
    <p>A webcomic featuring plump lil dudes with cute butts. The site and all of its functionality were built entirely with Hugo. This was my first foray into designing a site from top to bottom. The goal was to have the comic be the centerpiece, while the rest of the site showcased the aesthetic of the artist. I worked closely with Sam —the creator— to design the icons, banners, and font. The end result was this beautiful and responsive site.</p>

    <h4><a href="https://www.sf-ref.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Spotfire Reference</a></h4>
    {{< img src="spotfire.png" >}}
    <p>A documentation site with the contribution to the community of Spotfire developers. The sites UI was loosely based on a Material Design theme. It’s built entirely with Hugo, using Bootstrap for the styling and other JS libraries for the syntax highlighting and clipboard functionality.</p>

    {{< img src="safespring.png" >}}
    <p>An information site showcasing the fast, flexible and secure cloud services. Originally built using Jekyll, the entire site was migrated and refactored with Hugo. Not only was there a boost in speed, but the codebase was significant reduced.</p>
